            <p><b>Lennie Marino</b> <i>February 11, 2024</i></p>

            <p><em>SpongeBob the Movie</em> is such a fun and excited experience that every kid should see.
                I mean even adults would love it thats how good it is.It includes a good story with a lot of suspense.
                The movie starts off as fun just like every episode in the SpongeBob series. Then out of no where
                the movie takes a big turn. Everything gets dark and scary. Makes you wonder is this really a kids movie?
                As you make it to the middle of the movie it makes you chant for SpongeBob and Patrick to make 
                their adventure a sucess. With all the wild encounters It makes you think will they make it to shell city?

            </p>

            <p>My favorite character in the movie has to be patrick. Patrick never gives up and always supports Spongebob.
                Everyone needs that person in their lives and Patrick was the guy. Also Patrick isnt the brightest character
                which makes him the funniest. Even though the movie is scary and evil it still is one nof the funniest kids movies 
                in my opion. If you like a good laugh you cant go wrong with this movie!
